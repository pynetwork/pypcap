Python pcap module
------------------

this is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper for libpcap -
the current tcpdump.org version, the legacy version shipping with 
some of the BSD operating systems, and the WinPcap port for Windows.

example use:

>>> import pcap
>>> for ts, pkt in pcap.pcap():
...     print ts, `pkt`
... 

Building
--------

just try 'make', and then 'make install'

if your libpcap installation is missing the pcap-int.h header, you
will need to build against a libpcap build directory. modify the
CONFIG_ARGS in the Makefile to point to the location of your built
libpcap distribution, and try again.
